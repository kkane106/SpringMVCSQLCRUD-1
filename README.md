## This is my week 7 project: SpringMVCFileCRUD

I'm going to simply make a web application with a list that League of Legends Champions can be viewed, added to, or delete champions one by one from the list. It will also access the altered list if the user exits out of the application even though they weren't finished with the website just yet (i.e. if they were disconnected from the internet while they were using the web application).

***User Financials***


The goal of this week's project is to create files that store user financial data. I'm going to start off and make the project very basic.

To start, the goals are:

1) User enters their private String name, double monthlyIncome, and double monthlyExpenses.
2) This is written into a file which contains each user's attributes based off of their name.
3) User can delete their entire "account" based off of their name or just their current monthlyIncome and double monthlyExpenses.
4) User can create a new "account" with all of the fields or can just create a new monthlyIncome based off of their name.



Personal stretch:

1) If I get everything working I want to create a visual representation of the user's double realMonthlyIncome (getter only, create method for netGain and allow it to represent a loss too).

2) Create multiple fields for each monthly bill/expense/forecasted expense and extrapolate that out for a monthly basis so that the user would be shown what their double realAnnualIncome would be.

3) Lastly, the vision if I were skilled enough would be to recommend where users can cut down their expenses by categorizing their bills/expenses (similar to the app "MINT") and letting them know what might be discretionary spending versus "NEED" spending. A lot of people are terrible with their own finances when in reality it should be one of the most important things in their lives that they maintain and keep track of.
