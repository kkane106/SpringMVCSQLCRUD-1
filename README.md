## This is my week 7 project: SpringMVCFileCRUD

I created this simple Spring web application which utilized HTML, CSS, Java, Gradle, SQL, JDBC, and Spring MVC, 

Web application link: http://52.11.199.1:8080/SpringMVCFileCRUD/

This web application with a list that League of Legends Champions that can be viewed, added to, and has the feature of being able to delete champions one by one from the list.

Future features that I would like to include would be including jpg icons for each champion, the option to add icons when a user adds a champion, and the win rate% for each champion in ranked games. I also would take the time to clean up my files and refactor a bit. I know I have some frivolous code.

Stumbling points that I reached while creating this web application were lack of experience in setting up the controller and making sure the JSP files were connected properly.

##Saving the Below for a future project
***User Financials***


The goal of this week's project is to create files that store user financial data. I'm going to start off and make the project very basic.

To start, the goals are:

1) User enters their private String name, double monthlyIncome, and double monthlyExpenses.
2) This is written into a file which contains each user's attributes based off of their name.
3) User can delete their entire "account" based off of their name or just their current monthlyIncome and double monthlyExpenses.
4) User can create a new "account" with all of the fields or can just create a new monthlyIncome based off of their name.



Personal stretch:

1) If I get everything working I want to create a visual representation of the user's double realMonthlyIncome (getter only, create method for netGain and allow it to represent a loss too).

2) Create multiple fields for each monthly bill/expense/forecasted expense and extrapolate that out for a monthly basis so that the user would be shown what their double realAnnualIncome would be.

3) Lastly, the vision if I were skilled enough would be to recommend where users can cut down their expenses by categorizing their bills/expenses (similar to the app "MINT") and letting them know what might be discretionary spending versus "NEED" spending. A lot of people are terrible with their own finances when in reality it should be one of the most important things in their lives that they maintain and keep track of.
